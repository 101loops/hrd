hrd [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/101loops/hrd.png)](https://travis-ci.org/101loops/hrd)
===

This Go package extends the standard package [appengine.datastore](http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/appengine-go/appengine/datastore) with useful features:
- caching in local memory as well as memcache
- DSL for read, write and delete
- lifecycle hooks (e.g. beforeSave)
- logging of all datastore actions

The library is used in production and actively worked on. So expect things to change.

**This is still alpha quality. It may have one or two bugs and memory leaks.**

Pull requests are very welcome :)


### Installation
`go get github.com/101loops/hrd`

### Documentation

The [documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/101loops/hrd) is still quite incomplete.
I suggest having a look at the E2E tests to see how it is used.
